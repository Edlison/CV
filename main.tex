\Entry
My research mainly focus on strengthening \textbf{Small Language Models (SLMs)}, especially by improving their memory mechanisms and reasoning abilities to achieve efficient yet powerful intelligence. In parallel, I investigate \textbf{Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)} with an emphasis on model extraction attacks and defenses mechanisms. Ultimately, my goal is to build secure, robust, and trustworthy machine learning systems that contribute to the broader vision of Responsible AI.
